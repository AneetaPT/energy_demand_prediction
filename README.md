# Energy Demand Prediction

This project aims to forecast daily power demand using machine learning models. It combines historical power generation data with weather data to predict future power demand.

## Introduction

This project leverages machine learning techniques to forecast daily power demand, which is crucial for energy management and planning. By analyzing historical power generation data alongside weather data, the project aims to predict future power demand accurately.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository
   
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. The required packages are listed in the code files.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook files (`base2 - Copy.ipynb`) to explore the code and run the models.

## Data

The project uses two main datasets:

- **Daily Power Generation Data:** This dataset contains historical records of daily power generation from various sources.
- **Weather Data:** This dataset includes weather information such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, which can influence power generation.

## Models

The following machine learning models are implemented in this project:

- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
- Hybrid Models (e.g., LSTM with Attention, CNN-LSTM)

## Results

The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Results are visualized using plots and charts to provide insights into model performance.
